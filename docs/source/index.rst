Welcome to packerlabimaging's documentation!
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


This documentation contains detailed information about the code base of ``packerlabimaging``.
There are instructions for installation and guides to get you started with utilizing the package.


Please open an issue or pull request on the project's `Github <https://github.com/Packer-Lab/packerlabimaging>`_ page if you are encountering any problems with the package.

Introduction
++++++++++++

`packerlabimaging` is a Python package for essential processing and analysis of 2photon imaging data collected in the Packer Lab.

`packerlabimaging` was first designed to provide a toolbox of data processing methods and a structured data analysis framework for all-optical experiments, which combine 2-photon imaging, 2-photon stimulation and multiple other time-synced data streams (Packer et al., 2015, Nat Meth). However, the packerlabimaging toolbox can be more broadly applied to other configurations of imaging+ neuroscience experiments, such as any combination of imaging + behaviour tracking + sensory stimulation + electrophysiology, etc.
Especially, there are workflows for analysis and visualisation of standard Ca2+ imaging data, and of standard all-optical experiments. Out-of-the-box, the package is designed to work best with imaging experiments performed using a Bruker 2pPlus microscope system, PACKIO (REF) for experimental hardware temporal synchronisation and utilises Suite2p (REF) for processing of Ca2+ imaging data.
Packerlabimaging implements a structure of data storage and processing that is designed to be modular, highly intuitive and readily extendable to serve the end-userâ€™s unique analytic needs. This framework gives the user a single framework to integrate the data processing and analyses needs of a variety of multi-modal experiments.

This package is designed to work best with imaging experiments performed using PackIO, a Bruker 2pPlus microscope and Suite2p for Ca2+ imaging data processing for ROI detection.
Ultimately, the goal of this package is to jump-start your own analysis of your awesome experiment.
It should be completely usable and understandable for anyone with the correct data in hand and basic knowledge of Python. There are :ref:`tutorials` to help along the way.
We hope that it provides a useful structure to organize your experimental data, and some functionality to interact and process your data in an efficient manner.

Quick Start Guide
=================

The easiest way to get started with using ``packerlabimaging`` is to follow `Tutorial 1 - Initializing an Experiment`_.
This tutorial demonstrates how to setup a new experiment inside ``packerlabimaging`` for data processing and analysis.
The ``Experiment`` class is built from information provided for each constituent trial of the overall Experiment.

Then, to get started with plotting and data exploration, check out `Tutorial 3 - Making useful plots`_.
